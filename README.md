Basic Prefab Generation for Unity

I wrote this for a project I was working on. Not sure if it will be helpful for others in its current state, I might modify it to make it more re-useable for different projects.

Currently, it watches a folder for new files (in our case, these were .fbx 3d model files). When files are added, it creates Unity prefabs for each of the models.
